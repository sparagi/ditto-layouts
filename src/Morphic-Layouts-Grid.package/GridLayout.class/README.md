My instances lay the children of a morph out in a grid, with the specified number of rows or columns.  Essentially, I treat the submorphs as if they were in a 2D array.  If the rows are specified, the submorphs appear in the order first row, second row, et cetera.  If the columns are specified but the rows are not, the submorphs appear in the order first column, second column, et cetera.

I am exactly like TableLayout except that I allow the user to specify how many rows should be used.  My rows and columns may be different height and width from each other.
